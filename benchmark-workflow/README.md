# Benchmark Workflow

## Overview
> Selecting the best performing tool is crucial to any bioinformatic analysis. To do that, the best alternative is to follow the recommendations of studies that compute metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and others for the tools by comparing their predictions to a gold standard of interactions. Here we have considered all the available tools and finally compared performance of the ones following our selection criteria. Analyses are performed in open jupyter notebooks that can be easily updated with new methods.
