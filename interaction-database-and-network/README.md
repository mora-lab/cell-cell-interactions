# Cell-cell interaction map of the human lung -A database and a network

## Overview
> We built a map of cellular interactions in the human lung and investigated differences and mechanisms in both healthy lung and lung diseases. Cell-cell interaction prediction tools and available single-cell data was used to predict interactions following the format: source cell - ligand - receptor - target cell. neo4j was used to built a graph databse and its GDS plugin was used to perform network analysis, especially module generation and degree and centrality analyses.
