# Bioinformatics of cell-cell Interactions

## Overview
> The importance of cell-cell interactions in cell function, tissue homeostasis, disease and development, has been long acknowledged. However, until recently, studies were limited to pairs of cell types and few genes. Nowadays, single-cell transcriptomics generates data from all genes in all cell types (known and unknown) opening a path to a better description, prediction, and explanation of extracellular interaction networks and pathways.
